                               			Trees
strictly binary tree
if every non leaf has non empty left and right sub tree
a sbt with n leaves will have 2n -1 nodes 

level : n - 1 node
depth : max level of any leaf in a tree (of any kind)


complete binaary tree : 
of depth d is strickly binary tree all of whose leaves are at level 'd' / left most possible 


BALANCE BINARY TREE 	:
 
Binary search tree :
                      ->
